Diagnosis: Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy

Seizure type and frequency: GTCS, 3 in the last two months
                            Myoclonic seizures, most days
                            
Current anti-epileptic medication: Lamotrigine 125mg, bd
                                    Sodium Valproate 700mg in the morning and 800mg in the evening
                                    
I reviewed this 31-year-old man by telephone today. Since the last appointment he has stopped the topiramate. This has made him feel better in himself, less tired, but has not changed the seizure frequency significantly. He is also prescribed clobazam 10mg at night when required for bad seizure clusters and this helps.

As you know an MRI in 2015 was normal and the most recent EEG last year showed generalised spike and wave with photsensitivity. Mr Jones continues to get problems with anxiety which are a significant problem for him

Comments: I would suggest that Mr Jones takes a higher dose of sodium valproate, increasing to 800mg twice a day, then further by 100mg every week up to a maximum of 1000mg twice a day if necessary. At the next clinic appointment we can consider whether adding in brivetiracetam would be useful (Levetiracetam seemed to make his mood worse in the past).

I will give him another call in about a months time but he can contact us via the epilepsy helpline if he has any issues before then.
