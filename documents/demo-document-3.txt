Diagnosis: Epilepsy, unclassified


Dear doctor,

I reviewed this 52-year-old woman by video consultation today. She is still getting around 1 convulsive seizure per month. She is currently taking sodium valproate 400mg bd and has not made the change to lamotrigine yet as we discussed in our previous letters. She continues to have quite troublesome tremours which would be another reason to change from the sodium valproate to lamotrigine as well as the MHRA guidelines on prescribing valproate. I would suggest starting the lamotrigine at 25mg once a day and then increasing by 25mg every month until she is taking 75mg twice a day. At the same time I would reduce the sodium valproate by 100mg every fortnight.

I was pleased to hear that Mrs Williams has managed to reduce her alcohol intake significantly as well as complete more exercise which has made her feel quite a lot better. I am sure that this will help her from an epilepsy point of view as well.

As you know MRIs in the past have been normal and an EEG from ten years ago showed some non-specific changes only. Mrs Williams is still waiting for an appointment for an up to date EEG.

I will see her again in a few months time but Mrs Williams can contact us via the helpline before then if there are any issues.

Yours
