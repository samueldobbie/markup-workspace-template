Problem: Recurrant blackouts

Diagnosis: Probable epilepsy, unclassified


Dear doctor,

I reviewed this 34 year ol man today. He has had recurrent episodes of collapse probably for the last 8 months now. The latest episdoe occured after drinking two pints of cider. Mr Jones remembers feeling "a bit weird" whilst sitting on the setee before waking up on the floor with a headache

I spoke to his wife who said that usually the episodes last around 2 minutes and during them his eyes will be open and he will "shiver" whilst generally being quite stiff and sometimes making choking noises. His muscles ache after the epsidoes and he can be quite tired

Otherwise Mr Jones has chronic back pain for which he takes co-codamol. His father had a few seizures before he died with dementia a few years ago. He was born normally and did not have any febrile seizure or significant head injuries.

A recent MRI head has been normal.

Impression. On balance I think these events are probably epileptic seizures and so Mr Jones has epilepsy.

Comments. I will request and EEG and reccomend that Mr Jones starts taking lamotrigine, intially 25mg od increasing by 25mg every fortnight until he is taking 75mg twice a days.
I have given him some safety and driving advice and will ask our epilepsy nurses to contact him to go through things in more details
