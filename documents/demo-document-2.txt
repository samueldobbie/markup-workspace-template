Problem: Three episodes of transient loss of consciousness.
 
Diagnosis:            Epilepsy, probable focal onset
 
I reviewed this 53-year-old man by telephone today. He had an episode on the 3rd March 2018. He remembers going for a walk and then feeling his right arm shake. The next thing he remembers is waking up in the ambulance. He had bitten his tongue and the ambulance documention says that he was confused afterwards. He had a similar episodes in December 2018, which was unwitnessed, again he remembers his right arm shaking at the time before losing consciousness. At that time and a further episode four years ago when he woke up with blood on the sheets and a painful tongue. With hindsight this was probably a generalised tonic-clonic seizure.
 
He has hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia for which he is taking atorvastatin and Ramipril. You have also started him on lamotrigine. He is currently taking lamotrigine 50mg twice a day. He does not have any side effects from the lamotrigine. He has no other medical problems and was born normally. He has not had any significant head injuries in the past or febrile seizures. He has had a CT head in March which was normal and his recent EEG shows some left focal slowing. He has smoked for twenty years and drinks about 20 units of alcohol per week. He has a driving licence.
 
Plan: I suggest he increases the lamotrigine in steps of 25mg every fortnight to a new dose of 75mg bd. I will request a MRI brain and ask the epilepsy nurses to go over the new diagnosis of epilepsy. We had a discussion about the DVLA driving regulations which state that he needs to be a year free of seizures before driving again. He can contact us on our epilepsy helpline should he run into difficulties
